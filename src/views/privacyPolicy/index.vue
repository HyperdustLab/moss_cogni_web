Without limitation, we may disclose personal information to:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>(l) any other third parties as required or permitted by law, such as where we receive a subpoena.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>10.2 The Foundation does not allow Processors to Process your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permits them to Process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with the Foundation's instructions. However, the Foundation may share your Personal Data with third parties to Process on their own behalf. Such third parties would be considered joint Controllers of such Personal Data. Although joint Controllers have shared discretion over the purposes of Processing, all such Controllers should Process such shared Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws applicable to you as a Data Subject. We shall provide you the names of the third parties Processing your Personal Data upon written request. We invite you to review the privacy policies of those third parties.</p>
      <h2>11. NOTE ON DATA TRANSFERS TO THE USA</h2>
      <p>11.1 Some of the third parties mentioned in this Privacy Policy are or may be based in the USA. There are or may be surveillance measures in place in the USA by US authorities, which allow the storage of all Personal Data of all persons whose data has been transferred to the USA. This is done without any differentiation, limitation or exception based on the objective pursued and without any objective criteria that would make it possible to limit the access of the US authorities to the data and their subsequent use to very specific, strictly limited purposes.</p>
      <p>11.2 In the USA, Data Subjects may not have legal remedies that allow them to obtain access to the data concerning them and to obtain their correction or deletion. Similarly, there may be no effective judicial legal protection against general access rights of US authorities. Insofar as third-party recipients of Personal Data are based in the USA, the Foundation will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your Personal Data is appropriately protected through contractual arrangements, but we make no guarantee.</p>
      <h2>12. SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA</h2>
      <p>12.1 The Foundation has implemented appropriate elements of privacy by design in conjunction with technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of Personal Data from unauthorized or unlawful Processing. The Foundation uses a number of systems and applications to protect Personal Data at all times.</p>
      <p>12.2 In assessing the appropriate level of security as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects, the Foundation assesses the risks presented by the Processing of Personal Data. Such risks may include, but are not limited to, any accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, or access to Personal Data Processed by or on behalf of the Foundation, or other factors that may impact Data Subject rights and freedoms. The Foundation shall make reasonable attempts to ensure that any risks presented by the Processing of Personal Data are sufficiently mitigated by technological and/or organizational controls, including limited access of Personal Data utilizing access controls and password protections.</p>

      <p>13.3 When you open a link to X or other Social Media used by the Foundation, a direct connection may be established between your browser and the server of the Social Media. This provides the Social Media with the information that you have visited our Website with your IP Address and accessed the link. If you access a link to a network while logged into your account on the network concerned, the content of our website may be linked to your profile on the network (i.e., the network may link your visit to our website directly to your user account).

The following data may be collected without your intervention and stored by the Foundation until deletion, as is necessary in compliance with applicable laws: the IP address of the requesting computer; the name of your internet access provider (usually your internet access provider); the date and time of access; the name and URL of the retrieved file; the page and address of the website from which you were redirected to the website and, if applicable, the search term used; the country from which the website is accessed; the operating system of your computer and the browser you are using (provider, version and language); and the transmission protocol used.</p>
      <p>14.2 The collection and processing of this data is carried out for the purpose of enabling the use of the website (connection establishment), to permanently guarantee system security and stability and to enable the optimization of our internet offer as well as for internal statistical purposes. Our legitimate interest in data processing lies in the purposes described above.</p>
      <p>14.3 Only in the event of an attack on the network infrastructure or a suspicion of other unauthorized or abusive website use will the IP address be evaluated for the purpose of clarification and defence and, if necessary, used in the context of criminal proceedings to identify and take civil or criminal action against the users concerned. Our legitimate interest in data processing lies in the purposes described above.</p>
      <h2>15. COOKIES</h2>
      <p>15.1 When you browse, access and use our website, we may make use of the standard practice of placing tiny data files called cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking tools (herein, "Cookies") on your computer or other devices used to visit the website. Cookies are small bits of information that are automatically stored on the web browser of your device that can be retrieved by us. Further information can be found on <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">https://allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>
      <p>15.2 The type of information we collect includes, but is not limited to, uniquely identifying visitor information and information related to your usage preferences. We use these technologies to help us recognise you as a user, collect information about your use of the website to better customise our services and content for you, and collect information about your computer or other access devices to ensure that your account security has not been compromised by detecting irregular or suspicious account activities. By using the Platform, you agree and understand that we may collect and/or transmit any data collected to our third party service providers, such as analytics providers, which may also make use of such technologies described above. If you block or delete cookies, we may not be able to provide you with all of the services on the website.</p>
      <h2>16. TRACKING TOOLS</h2>
      <p>16.1 We use various web analytics services to monitor activity on our websites, including but not limited to Google Analytics. These generate information about your use of the website, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) Navigation path that a visitor follows on the website;</li>
        <li>(b) How long you spend on the website and subpages;</li>
        <li>(c) The subpage from which you leave the website;</li>
        <li>(d) The country, region or city from where you access the website;</li>

      <p>16.2 According to Google, this information is transmitted to servers in the U.S. and is stored there. However, according to Google, in the process, the IP Address is shortened by activating IP anonymization on the website before transmission within the EU. The anonymized IP Address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data, according to Google. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and shortened there. In these cases, we will use reasonable efforts to seek to ensure that Google implements a sufficient level of data protection by means of contractual representations and assurances, in particular by agreeing to the standard contractual clauses and additional measures in applicable jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>16.3 This information may be used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activities and to provide other services associated with website and internet use for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented design of the website. We may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on our behalf. However, under no circumstances will an IP address be associated with other data relating to the user.</p>
      <p>16.4 The legal basis for processing data for the above purposes is your consent, which you give us by accepting the Terms of Use of the website. You can revoke your consent at any time by contacting us.</p>
